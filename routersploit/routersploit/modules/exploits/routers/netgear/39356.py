# Exploit Title: Netgear_WNR1000v4_AuthBypass
# Google Dork: -
# Date: 06.10.2015
# Exploit Author: Daniel Haake
# Vendor Homepage: http://www.netgear.com/
# Software Link: http://downloadcenter.netgear.com/en/product/WNR1000v4
# Version: N300 router firmware versions 1.1.0.24 - 1.1.0.31
# Tested on: Can be exploited using a browser
# CVE : requested


Introduction:
-------------
Multiple NETGEAR wireless routers are out of the box vulnerable
to an authentication bypass attack. No router options has to
be changed to exploit the issue. So an attacker can access the administration
interface of the router without submitting any valid username and
password, just by requesting a special URL several times.


Affected:
---------
- Router Firmware: N300_1.1.0.31_1.0.1.img
- Router Firmware; N300-1.1.0.28_1.0.1.img
- Router Firmware; N300-1.1.0.24_1.0.1.img
- tested and confirmed on the WNR1000v4 Router with both firmwares
- other products may also be vulnerable because the firmware is used in multiple devices


Technical Description:
----------------------
The attacker can exploit the issue by using a browser or writing a simple exploit.
1. When a user wants to access the web interface, a http basic authentication login process is initiated
2. If he does not know the username and password he gets redirected to the 401_access_denied.htm file
3. An attacker now has to call the URL http://<ROUTER-IP>/BRS_netgear_success.html multiple times
-> After that if he can access the administration web interface and there is no username/password prompt
